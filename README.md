# üìä APPLYING STATISTICAL MODELING TO ANALYZE AND PREDICT STORAGE CAPACITY UTILIZATION

## üìù Abstract
This project presents a predictive modeling approach to manage storage capacity utilization in artifact repository managers like Sonatype Nexus Repository (NXRM). Leveraging Python and machine learning techniques, we developed a regression-based model to forecast storage requirements, enabling proactive capacity management and reducing risks of unexpected server downtime.

The research addresses the challenges of managing digital artifacts (Maven, npm, Docker, etc.) in agile and DevOps workflows. It demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven strategies for optimizing storage utilization by analyzing historical log data, performing feature engineering, and applying univariate linear regression. The solution empowers administrators with insights for proactive storage planning and aligns with modern software development lifecycle (SDLC) requirements.
